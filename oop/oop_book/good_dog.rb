# Notes:

# When defining a class,
#   states: track attributes for individual objects with instance variables
#   behaviors: what objects can do, using instance methods.
  
# name=(new_name) is syntactical suger. Can be called with assignment syntax:
#   fido.name = "Fidelius"
  
# attr_accessor sets up getter and setter methods for 1 or more instance variables
# attr_reader  - getter method only
# attr_writer  - setter method only

# Using getter methods rather than instance variables directly makes it possible to
# alter them for use. For example, obscuring all but the last 4 digits of a ssn with 
# the method below. '@ssn' will be the entire number. 'ssn' will be x's and the last 4. 

def ssn                                # getter method for retrieving the ssn
  'xxx-xx-' + @ssn.split('-').last
end

# 3 uses for modules:

# 1. Modules for mixins.

# 2. Modules for namespacing: grouping similar classes under a module to keep codebase 
# organized. Useful for differentiating from other similarly-named classes.

# 3. Modules as a container for methods (module methods) that seem out of place.

# Public, private, and protected

# Public methods can be called on objects (classes or instances).
# Private methods are written below the keyword 'private' within the class definition.
#   They can be used within the class (even by public methods) only when used without
#   'self'. Outside the class
#   they don't exist; attempting to use them will throw a NoMethodError.
# Protected methods likewise exist only within the class, but can be called with 'self'.
