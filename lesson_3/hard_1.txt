Q1.

nil. The variable is initialized in an if block that hasn't been executed, so no
exception is raised.

Q2.

{:a=>"hi there"} because informal_greeting referenced the original object and 
the << modified it.

Q3.

A) I don't think reassignment with = is permanent within a method. It alters only
the local variables created by passing in parameters.

B) Same

C) .gsub! modifies the original object, so

  one is two
  two is three
  three is one
  
Q4.

HEX_CHARS = ("a".."f").to_a + ("0".."9").to_a

def create_uuid
  uuid = ""
  8.times { uuid << HEX_CHARS.sample }
  uuid << "-"
  3.times do
    4.times { uuid << HEX_CHARS.sample }
    uuid << "-"
  end
  12.times { uuid << HEX_CHARS.sample }
  uuid
end

Q5.

def dot_separated_ip_address?(input_string)
  dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
  return false unless dot_separated_words.size == 4
  4.times do
    word = dot_separated_words.pop
    return false unless is_an_ip_number?(word)
  end
  true
end
