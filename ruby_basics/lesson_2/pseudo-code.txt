1. A method that returns the sum of two intergers:

  Casual:
  
  Within a method definition that takes two interger variables, add them together. 
  
  
  Formal: 
  
  START
  
  SET a method definition that takes two intergers
    SET a variable as the sum of interger1 and interger2
  END the method
  
  END


2. A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings
concatenated together.

  Casual:
  
  Use the .join method.
  
  
  Formal:
  
  START
  
  SET a method definition that takes an array of strings.
    READ the array and call the .join method. The result will be returned.
  END
  
  END
  
  
3. A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element.

  Casual:
  
  Define a method that takes an array of intergers. For each element in the array, check its
  index. If the index modulus 2 is zero, push it to a new array. Return the new array.
  
  Formal:
  
  START
  
  SET new_array to []
  SET a method definition that takes array_of_intergers.
    READ the array with an each/do block
      IF the index modulus 2 is zero, push it to new_array.
      END
    END
  END the method
  
  END the program
