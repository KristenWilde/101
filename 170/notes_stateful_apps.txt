The HTTP protocol is stateless; the server does not hang on to information 
between each request/response cycle. Different requests are not aware of 
each other.

How to make an app seem stateful:

1. Sessions

A session identifier is a token that the server provides, and the client appends
it to each request. Valid for a certain amount of time.

2. Cookies

Small files stored in the browser containing the session information.
Find them in DevTools > Application > Cookies. Session id is one of 
them.

3. AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript (Calls || and XML))

allows browsers to issue requests and process responses without a full page
refresh.
