puts <<-STORY
Once upon a time, on a bright #{adj4} day, while #{name} was out #{verb_ing}, 
#{pronoun} looked out over the #{nature}. There in the distance was something 
small, furry, and #{color1}. 

'#{exclamation.capitalize}!! That must be my baby #{animal1},' thought #{name}. 
#{name} rushed over to pick up the little #{color1} thing, when suddenly it 
shot out a #{adj1} spray that smelled like #{smell}. 

'#{exclamation.upcase}, that was not my #{animal1}!' cried #{name}. 
#{pronoun.capitalize} #{verb_ed1} right into a nearby puddle of #{substance} to 
try to get the #{smell} smell off, but instead #{pronoun} just got covered with 
#{substance}. There was a #{body_of_water} nearby, so #{name} jumped right in - 
but it was much too #{adj2}. #{adj2.capitalize}, wet, and smelling strongly of 
#{smell}, #{name} #{verb_ed2} #{adverb} toward home as dark #{color2} clouds 
gathered above. 

'I don't know how I'm ever going to get this #{smell} off', #{pronoun} thought.
Just then #{pronoun} felt a big #{adj3} drop of rain on the #{body_part1}. 'And
now it's raining #{animal2}s and #{animal3}s!' #{name} #{verb_ed3} through 
the downpour as quickly as #{pronoun} could, but was soaked to the 
#{body_part2} when #{pronoun} arrived at home. 

'Can I go in the house all #{adj2}, covered with #{substance}, and smelling 
like #{smell}?' wondered #{name}. #{pronoun.capitzlize} looked down and gave a 
sniff.

'#{exclamation.capitalize}! The rain has #{verb_ed4} me clean!!' #{name} went 
into the house, and there was #{name}'s little #{animal1} waiting for a hug.

THE #{noun.upcase}.
